## GUARD
Some kind of exponential DP problem based on low number of cows
Can't do 20!, but can do 2^20
Reread the problem, don't understand what the soltuion to the sample case is

## MARATHON
Segment tree problem
When merging segments, see if skipping the end of the first segment or beginning of the second segment is better than skipping something in the middle
O(nlogn) time

## COW JOG
Lots of ways to approach this
Put all cows of same speed in same lane, merge as appropriate
Cows with the same initial position must be in different lanes
