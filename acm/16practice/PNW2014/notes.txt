Hella WA on A. Read carefully and make sure you handle edge cases / validate
numbers if you're generating them.

B seems really fucking hard, no clue at all.

C cannot be solved greedily, is max flow. D'oh! Got it right once I was careful
about edge weights.

D is some nutso recursive function that you probably have to simplify.

E is hard DP. Should know how to do, but I don't :(.

F is matrix exponentiation. Figure out the matrix, then it shouldn't be too bad. You need to keep track of at most 4 * 3, so 12. Try with every possible start and you'll get the answer.

G I have no idea how to do this. Need to figure out how to reduce to nim?

H should be simple knapsack. Forward DP makes this so much easier to read.

I is my favorite problem. Preorder traversal into a lazy segment tree! Unfortunately I don't know / understand lazy updates, so this isn't working.

J seems like a brute force, but I don't understand the sample IO.

K is simple backtracking.

L is right according to official IO. The ICPC site is busted.
